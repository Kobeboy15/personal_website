              I&apos;ve always had a creative background for as long as I can
              remember. From dealing with photography and film-making, to
              working on art vectors in Adobe Illustrator. I always had an eye
              for what I found was interesting, and trying to understand what
              made them interesting in the first place.
              <br />
              <br />
              As I got older, I eventually got my first exposure to Web
              Development and Design around my junior year of high school. We
              were tasked to design a personal web portfolio, using HTML and
              CSS. There I understood that there was a complexity behind all of
              this, dealing with numbers, percentages, and math, but I also
              could see there was an art-form with how you structure content and
              visualize it for a user. Presentation was essential in order for a
              web application to be usable by many. I immediately got hooked on
              that concept, and ever since then, I&apos;ve wanted to become a
              developer as my main job.
              <br />
              <br />
              Currently, I&apos;ve leaned into the position of being a Frontend
              Engineer, but I also pride myself on creating stunning and unique
              designs that cater to a client&apos;s want and needs for their
              application. I&apos;m always learning and always hungry for new
              opportunities.
